# Project Introduction: 
This is a proffessional web application for searching, researching and tracking propertes on the real estate market in Bulgaria. By this platform any professional broker could create account and start researching the properties which his own clients looking for by creating a certain SearchSets with certain searching criterias. If any of the properties satisfy the needs of the client the application allows to track them in the time. The accent is to keep up-to-date every registered user with the newest properties at the market. The app has two additional features when the SearchSet system is used - to notice all newly appeared properties by certain SearchSet or at whole, and the second - to show the most profitable properties by all of the criterias in the certain SearchSet. And one more useful feature - every registered user could see each of his catched properties in which SearchSets belong. This is useful to optimise broker job combining searching of aimed properties among his clients.
